# Madi's Sweets Shop

Madison Peper owns a sweets shop that sells brand name candies, and in-house baked goods. Madi wants a simple command line tool that will allow her to see all of the products that she sells on a daily basis. She hired her nephew to begin the development process, but he had to go off to college and couldn't complete the work. She hired you to complete the project and your payment will be free cookies for a year.

## Step 1: Redesign

You must use your knowledge of inheritance to reduce the amount of duplicated properties and methods across all of the classes that her nephew designed, so that the code is more easily maintained and modified.

## Step 2: Display Baked Good

When you have completed your inheritance strategy, Madi would like to have all baked goods grouped together for the main display case of her store. You will add all baked goods, and no candies, to a single list so that they can be printed out in the terminal at the same time.

## Tips

1. You may need to define more than one, all-encompassing base class.
2. You may need multiple levels of inheritance **Base -> Derived Child -> Derived Grandchild**.
3. Draw out all of the possible groups, and sub-groups before writing any code.
